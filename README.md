This is the code for a paper that is being reviewed by the journal Information Sciences.

anomaly_detection.py is the core code of the algorithm in this paper, which implements an increment-based DDoS attack detection method. decomposition.py is the code for part of the comparison algorithm, which is used in section 5.3 "Experimental Results and Analysis" of the paper.

It should be noted that we do not currently open source experimental data sets and part of the algorithm code, because they involve our next work and the privacy of several authors, we will be in the future when appropriate sequence open source.
